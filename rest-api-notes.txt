What is REST API-vs1
Requirements basic JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB

API: Application Programming Interface

REST: REpresentaitional State Transfer
    ie: remote control interface with TV
    ie: application, youtube, interface, series of end points (https//)
    ie: developers use API's like uber, twitter, gmaps, Utube
    Query list of drives in Json format

REST: REpresentaitional State Transfer
    Architectual style of the web
    A standard / set of guidelines by which we can structue and create API's
    REST API's have identifiable properties
    
REST Properties:
    1. They make use of Resource-based URL's
        Webpage - scores, teams, arsenal 
            GET request for rersouce in html
        JSON - api, scores, teams, aresnal
            /resource based with / 
    2. They make use of HTTP methods
        GET - used to retrieve data from the server
        POST - used to send data server
        PUT - used to update data
        DELETE - used to delete data
    3. They make use of HTTP status codes
        200 - means OK
        404 - means resource not found
        500 - means server errors
        Network tab, header

    Objectives:
    1. Learn about HTTP methods and what they're for
    2. Create an API using Node.js, Express & MongoDB
    3. Test our API using POSTMAN
    4. Create a simple front-end to interact with our API
